# UFO Sightings

# overview of Project

Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, you’ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

# Overview and Resources used
The source of the UFO sightings data the data file provided in a JavaScript format.
The index.html provided the bones for the web page.
The tools used included: JavaScript, Jupyter Notebook.


#Deliverable 1:

Using JavaScript and HTML, you’ll modify the code in your index.html file to create more table filters. In addition to the date filter, you created in this module, you’ll add filters for the city, state, country, and shape, as shown in the following image:

# Deliverable 2 Summary

To filter the data simply enter the desired information that you wish to filter on.

For example, if you wanted to know when triangle shapes appear simple enter triangle into the shape.

To further narrow down the search result enter additional criteria. For example, State.

It should be noted that it may appear that there is data in the fields, however this is just information so that the format of each cell is known. 

One of the drawbacks of the web page is it is from a very limited data set. The only data comes from a file, and it only shows information that was placed in the file.

One area that can be used in future development is to get a larger data set that can be imported for analysis.

An additional future development is to pull data from additional sources to include additional web pages that source the information real time. This will remove the limitations of a specified database or file.
